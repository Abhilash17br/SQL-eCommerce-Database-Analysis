Subject: Recent Product Launch
Good morning,
On December 12th 2013, we launched a third product
targeting the birthday gift market (Birthday Bear).
Could you please run a pre-post analysis comparing the
month before vs. the month after, in terms of session-to
order conversion rate, AOV, products per order, and
revenue per session?
Thank you
Cindy

Subject: Quality Issues & Refunds
Good morning,
Our Mr. Fuzzy supplier had some quality issues which
weren't corected until September 2013. Then they had a
major problem where the bears' arms were falling off in
Aug/Sep 2014. As a result, we replaced them with a new
supplier on September 16, 2014.
Can you please pull monthly product refund rates, by
product, and confirm our quality issues are now fixed?
-Cindy
